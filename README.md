# Stau2 project
Repository contains code for the analysis of STAU2 Rip-Seq data. Data was mapped with STARmapper to UCCSC mm10 genome, 
then peaks were identiifed with Homer, and differential peak expression was determined with Homer. Using R a stablization score 
was calculated per gene and that were unstable across the time-course were identified.
